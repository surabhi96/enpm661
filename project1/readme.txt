This project involves implementing a Brute Force Search (BFS) method to solve the 8-Puzzle problem. 
The source file in this project will solve a valid input matrix to yield an output matrix as shown below.
output = 	1 2 3
			4 5 6 
			7 8 0

Instructions to run hw1.cpp: (Note: use Ubuntu to run the code for better performance)
1) g++ -std=c++11 hw1.cpp -o hw1
2) ./hw1

On running the code, you will be prompted to enter an input. Note that the input matrix should be entered row wise. 
After entering the input, the code will start solving the puzzle if the input was valid else it will prompt you to enter a valid input. 
After solving the puzzle, you will be prompted to enter (Y/y) corresponding to yes or (N/n) corresponding to no, to print the path taken to reach the goal state. Press (Y/y) to save the desired result in the corresponding text files. 

Thank you!
